There are **Products** that are sold in **Stores**.

- **Stores** have a code (unique), a name (not necessarily unique) and an address.
- **Products** have a code (unique), a name (not necessarily unique).

Each store has its own price for the product and there is a certain number of units in stock (some product may not be available at all).

### Make methods for the following operations:
- Create a store.
- Create a product.
- Bring a batch of goods to the store (set of goods-quantity with the ability to set/change the price).
- Find a store in which a certain product is the cheapest.
- Understand what goods can be bought in a store for a certain amount (for example, for 100 rubles you can buy three kg of cucumbers or two chocolates).
- Buy a batch of goods in the store (parameters - how many of which goods to buy, the method returns the total purchase price or its impossibility if there is not enough goods).
- Find in which store the batch of goods (set item-quantity) has the smallest amount (in total). For example, "which store is the cheapest to buy 10 nails and 20 screws." Availability of goods in stores is taken into account!

For demonstration you need to create at least 3 different stores, 10 types of goods and fill the stores with them.
